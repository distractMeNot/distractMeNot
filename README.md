# distractMeNot

This filter list blocks elements that are legitimate parts of a website, but try to distract you from the *the topic at hand*. Such distractions may be "popular now", "most read", and similar elements that promote different topics. Blocking "related content" elements is not in scope for this list, because "Reader view" in modern browsers such as [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/) already removes *all* the non-content stuff.

The list is intended to for use in blocker addons such as [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#beware-ublock-origin-is-completely-unrelated-to-the-web-site-ublockorg), [Adblock Plus Element Hiding Helper](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/elemhidehelper/), etc.
